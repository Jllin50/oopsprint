What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?

    One important part of code reviews is finding ways to improve existing code, even
if there is nothing wrong with it. By finding ways to simplify or speed up existing code people can
help each other become better programmers overall. Something that I appreaciate about code reviews is that because
other people have different levels of coding experience than myself, they often show me other ways to solve a problem. For example a beginning coder
might point out a simpler, more basic solution where I might be over complicating things.



We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?

Containers such as the ones we used with docker can help code become reproducible. 
This means that on each of the acme corp. computers we could connect to a container and have it load 
all the code. Imagine if the company had to manually load the files on to each computer or even worse write
the code to each computer. Containers can save a lot of time and money as they allow code to seamlessly get distributed accross
multiple systems, which would otherwise require a lot of developer time.
